I want to create app that involves a rowing community, like discord but only for rowers. Teams could use it for summer break to keep check with their athletes and the athletes could upload their workout for the coaches to see.
The athletes could have their own chat to discuss about workouts/setting up a in person meeting to workout toghter over the summer.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenges I encountered was setting up xcode on my mac, as it took me awhile to get the hang of downloading it. In the end the instruction were easy to follow and I had the ability to produce my own app
